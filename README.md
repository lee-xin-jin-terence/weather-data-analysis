# 🌤 Weather Data Analysis in C++

This C++ project processes and analyzes historical weather data (e.g., solar radiation and wind speed) logged every 10 minutes from 1998 onward. The data is read from CSV files, each containing a full year's worth of sensor readings.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Object-oriented design for modular, maintainable code  
- Reads and processes multiple weather data files  
- Extracts sensor values like solar radiation and wind speed  
- Menu-driven interface for interacting with data  

## ⭐ Bonus Feature

- Given a date (e.g., `11/1/2019`), the program identifies and displays all times that recorded the **highest solar radiation** for that day.

### 📋 Sample Output

Date: 11/1/2019
High solar radiation for the day: 1046 W/m²
Time: 10:40
